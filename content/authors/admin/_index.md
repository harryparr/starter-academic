I am a PhD Candidate at the ICR-CTSU, my project focuses on developing a clinical dynamic prediction models, or joint model, in order to predict the prognosis of prostate cancer patients post neoadjuvant- and concurrent hormone- and radiotherapy. My supervisors are [Prof Emma Hall](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/research-divisions/division-of-clinical-studies/urology-and-head-and-neck-trials-team/research-overview), [Dr Nuria Porta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nuria_Porta), [Dr Alison Tree](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/our-consultants-units-and-wards/consultant-directory/dr-alison-tree), and recently retired [Prof David Dearnaley](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-david-dearnaley)
